# Unofficial Python Code to Download from Vectorizer AI

This is an unofficial Python script that automates the download process from Vectorizer AI. It allows users to upload a file, and once the process is complete, it will notify you with a "Download Successful!" alert.

Before running the script, you need to install the `drissionpage` package, which will open a web interface for you to upload your file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

### Install Dependencies

Before using the script, you need to install the `drissionpage` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install drissionpage
````

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   If you haven't already, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the required library:

   ```bash
   pip install drissionpage
   ```

2. **Download the Script:**

   Clone or download the Python script from this repository.

3. **Run the Python Script:**

   After installing the necessary package, run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python vectorizer.py
   ```

   This will open the web interface in your browser.

4. **Upload Your File:**

   * The script will automatically open a web page where you can upload your file to Vectorizer AI.
   * After uploading, the script will process the file.

5. **Download Notification:**

   Once the fetch process finishes, an alert will notify you with the message:

   ```
   Download Successful!
   ```

   Your downloaded file will be available for you to use.

## Troubleshooting

* **If the web page doesn't load:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
* **If you encounter a permission error:** Make sure you're running the script with the necessary permissions to access the web interface.
* **If the script doesn't alert you after the download:** Double-check if your file was uploaded correctly, and ensure the fetch process has completed.
